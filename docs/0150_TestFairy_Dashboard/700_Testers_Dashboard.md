### Testers Dashboard

The [Testers Dashboard](https://my.testfairy.com/) is the place where testers see all the apps they were invited to test.
This view is available to all testers in the system. 

Developers can switch from this view to the full dashboard view with the `view as developer` menu item.

### Menu
In the app view you can see all the apps designated to the tester.


Each app has all its details including:
- App name
- App <a href=https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id target=_blank> **applicationId**</a>
- App <a href=https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning target=_blank> **versionName**</a>
- Update date - when it was last uploaded to the system


The green button is for downloading the app to your device.

If you press the `+` sign you will see the app's **release notes** and a link to view all **previous versions** of the app that are also available for download.

In the menu there is an option to see **My Apps** in the account, see **My Devices** (you will see only registered iOS devices) and **Log Out** of the account.

If an iOS application does not install on your device, we recommend that you run the `troubleshooting` tool:

1. Open your TestFairy account via the link [my.testfairy.com](https://my.testfairy.com) on the device you want to test.


2. Click the Tester icon ![](/img/tester/tester-icon-1.png) menu and choose **Troubleshooting**.


3. Click the `START` button to start the troubleshooting process.


4. Click **allow** to let the configuration profile download.


5. Close and go to the **settings app**. Click on the **profile downloaded** menu.


6. Install the configuration profile previously downloaded.


7. After the installation is complete, you will be directed to review the troubleshooting results.
