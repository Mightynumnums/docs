Single Sign-on enables you to manage users and testers outside of TestFairy. A list of permitted users and testers, as well as their passwords, is stored in PingIdentity. Therefore onboarding a new developer into the team is an easy task.

When SSO is configured into your account, the login page is replaced with a simple `login with sso` button.
