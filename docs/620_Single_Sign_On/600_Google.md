Single Sign-on enables you to manage users and testers outside of TestFairy. A list of permitted users and testers, as well as their passwords, is stored in Google Apps. Therefore onboarding a new developer into the team is an easy task.

When SSO is configured into your account, the login page is replaced with a simple `Login with Google` button.

#### Troubleshooting

- `Error: app_not_configured_for_user`. If you are seeing this error message on Google, then it means that you:
  - Didn't enable this app for the current user or for all users. Please see in installation section above, how to enable the newly created app for all users.
  - Accidentally provided wrong **ACS URL** or **Entity ID**. Please see installation section above for the correct values. Notice that every single character matters as values *MUST* be identical for verification.
