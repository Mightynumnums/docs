Single Sign-on enables you to manage users and testers outside of TestFairy. A list of permitted users and testers, as well as their passwords, is stored in OKTA. Therefore onboarding a new developer into the team is an easy task.

#### [Optional:] Automatically importing groups from OKTA

When managing large teams with OKTA, it is most likely that people are already associated with groups. 

For example, say Alice is associated with the following groups in OKTA: ["QA", "QA San Francisco"]. 
With auto-import of groups, Alice will automatically be associated with the following groups in TestFairy next time she signs in: "okta", "okta-qa", and "okta-qa-san-francisco". 
Once removed from group "QA", Alice will be automatically be removed from "okta-qa" group in TestFairy, next time she signs in.

In order to import groups each time a user signs into TestFairy, please follow these instructions. 

1. Open the TestFairy app in your OKTA account, select the Sing On tab, and click Edit.

2. Click on "Attributes"
 ![](https://docs.testfairy.com/img/sso/okta/okta2.png)

3. Under `Group Attribute Statements`, add a rule with name: "groups", (LOWERCASE!!!) and filter "Matches regex" with value `.*`. (dot asterisk)
