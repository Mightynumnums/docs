## Before you start

In order to connect TestFairy to JIRA Server that is installed on-prem, start by [installing TestFairy Connect](/Bug_Tracking/TestFairy_Connect.html)

## Configuring TestFairy Connect with JIRA Server

This guide explains how to configure the TestFairy Connect agent to work with an on-premise JIRA using basic-authentication (user/password-token) or OAuth.

#### Using the wizard

Start the wizard by typing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```sh
$ testfairy-connect configure
```

**Welcome to TestFairy Connect configuration wizard.**

  Please provide the url address of your JIRA server. Don't forget to include the http:// or https:// prefix.

- **How shall TestFairy Connect authenticate to JIRA?** 
  
  Please choose "basic"

- **What is the type of JIRA issues to be created using TestFairy Connect?**

---------------------------------

## Configure JIRA with OAuth

#### Access token & secret generation:

1. Obtain a keypair:
	
	```
	openssl genrsa -out jira_rsa 2048
	openssl rsa -in jira_rsa -pubout > jira_rsa.pub
	```
	
2. Configure JIRA the Application Link for TestFairy Connect integration.
In your browser, go to your JIRA Admin page, like http://localhost:2990/jira/plugins/servlet/applinks/listApplicationLinks. 
Enter 'url' or any string to use for Application Link identification.

  ![Create an Application Link](https://docs.testfairy.com/img/testfairy-connect/1-create-application-link.png)

  In the next screen, click 'Continue'.
  
  ![Continue](https://docs.testfairy.com/img/testfairy-connect/2-continue.png)

  ![Setup Application Link](https://docs.testfairy.com/img/testfairy-connect/3-setup-application-link.png)
  
  - Application Name: TestFairy
  - Application Type: Generic Application
  - Service Provider Name: TestFairy
  - Consumer Key: testfairy-connect
  - Shared Secret: [paste public key contents here]
  - Request Token URL: /plugins/servlet/oauth/request-token
  - Request Token URL: /plugins/servlet/oauth/access-token
  - Request Token URL: /plugins/servlet/oauth/authorize

  ![Verify Access Token](https://docs.testfairy.com/img/testfairy-connect/4-verify-access-token.png)

3. Run the token generation script found [here](https://docs.testfairy.com/js/download/oauth.js). Right-click to copy .js file path. 
	
	```
	wget [paste file path here]
	npm install oauth
	node oauth.js
	```
	
4. Update your config.json with `access_token` and `access_token_secret`.


5. (optional) Install the TestFairy Chrome Extension

The TestFairy Chrome Extension is available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/testfairy-for-jira/joaafaemekbkgekhjbaldlllcnjifcee). With this Chrome extension, every JIRA issue that has a link to a TestFairy session will contain the right TestFairy session, timeline, logs, and crash reports enbedded in the JIRA issue.
