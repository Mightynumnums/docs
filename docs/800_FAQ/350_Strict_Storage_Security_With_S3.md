The *NEW UPLOAD* button in your account is disabled because of strict storage security.

Your account is configured to work with your own private CDN. This means that all of the app artifcats (IPA and APK files) are stored on a self-managed S3 bucket. In this case, to upload files, you will have to use the [Upload API](https://docs.testfairy.com/API/Upload_API.html) and provide presigned URLs to an artficat for processing.
