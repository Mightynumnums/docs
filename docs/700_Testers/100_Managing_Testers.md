###### **Note for iOS only**
  If you are **not** using an [iOS Enterprise certificate](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/enterprise/), you  will need to get the UDID's of your testers' devices before sending them your app.   
         When you invite new testers by email, your testers will get an email asking them to register their device. Once they click on the registration link, you will get an email with their UDID and their device details will be added to your [testers page](https://app.testfairy.com/testers).  
         For more information about how to add UDIDs to provisioning profiles please read [this guide](http://docs.testfairy.com/iOS_SDK/Adding_UDIDs_to_iOS_development_profile.html).

Tester groups help you manage the invitation process to your apps. If you want to invite a number of testers that are all under the same group simply filter the list of testers according to that group and then select all and invite them.
