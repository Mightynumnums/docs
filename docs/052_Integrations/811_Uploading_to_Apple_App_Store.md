You need to create credentials from Apple iTunesConnect in order to upload apps. You can get the credentials by going to the [User and Access](appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/api), selecting the **Keys** tab, and then selecting "App Store Connect API" form the right-side menu. Click the '+' button to add a new set of keys. Be sure to download the .p8 file used to signed API requests, and take note of the **Issuer ID** and the **Key ID**. Note, you'll have to give **Admin access** to these keys in order to upload an app from TestFairy to the Apple App Store.

The meta data can be generated by your build system with the following command:

```
xcrun swinfo -f /path/to/app.ipa -o /path/AppStoreInfo.plist -plistFormat binary
```

Once the meta data has been uplaoded, you will see an upload dialog that summarizes what will be uploaded to Google Play Store.

**Note**: TestFairy will not publish your app publically, it will upload the build to the store in, bute requires the owner of the app in apple iTunesConnect to publish the app itself pubically.

After uploading, the dialog will display the uploaded state of the app.
