## Zendesk
If you are using Zendesk as your support and ticketing system it is very easy to integrate it with your testfairy account to collect feedback you receive from customers.


From the __Integration__ menu choose `Zendesk` and press the `Add Integration` button - It will open the __Zendesk Integration__ Dialogue.

Add your `Zendesk Subdomain` , `Email` address of your account and the `API Key` you created in your [SUBDOMAIN]zendesk.com/agent/admin/api/settings/tokens.

Once you `Save Settings` your integration is ready.
