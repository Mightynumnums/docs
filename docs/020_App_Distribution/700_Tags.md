Tags are text labels that can be attached to builds and used for identification and search. Every build (app version) can have different tags.

## Adding Tags Via Upload API

Tags can be added when uploading the build via the upload API (see [Upload API](https://docs.testfairy.com/API/Upload_API.html)) using the `tags` parameter.

## Adding and Editing Tags

Once a build is available on your dashboard, tags can be added, edited, and deleted in the build settings menu.

## Displaying Tags to Admins

Tags appear on project pages.
