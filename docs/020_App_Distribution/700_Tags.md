## Tags

Tags are text labels that can be attached to builds and used for identification and search. Every build (app version) can have different tags.

#### How to add tags to builds that are uploaded via API

- Tags can be added programmatically when uploading the build via the [TestFairy Upload API](https://docs.testfairy.com/API/Upload_API.html) using the `tags` parameter.


#### How to add/edit tags to existing builds

- Once the build is already available in your dashboard, Tags can be added, edited or deleted in [build settings](https://docs.testfairy.com/TestFairy_Dashboard/Builds.html) menu under __App Distribution__ --> __Tags__.

#### Displaying tags to admins

Tags appear in a project page:

In the dashboard, Tags are searchable in the `Search...` textbox available at the top right.

#### Displaying tags to testers

Testers can see Tags in their Testers Dahsboard available at [my.testfairy.com](my.testfairy.com):

Tags are also available at the top of every landing page, just below the main headline:
