## Tags

Tags are labels attached to builds for identification and give additional searchable information about them.

The text may contain spaces and more than one word.

#### Ways to edit tags

- They are first added when uploading the build via the [upload API](https://docs.testfairy.com/API/Upload_API.html) using the `tags` parameter.

- Once the build is loaded they can be edited in the [build settings](https://docs.testfairy.com/TestFairy_Dashboard/Builds.html) menu under __App Distribution__ --> __Tags__.

#### Displaying tags

Once tags are added they appear in a the build details:

`Tags` are searchable in the `Search...` field at the top of the table.

They also appear in the details of the build in the [my.testfairy.com](my.testfairy.com) (for the Tester view):
