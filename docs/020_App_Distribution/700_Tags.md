## Tags

Tags are text labels that can be attached to builds and used for identification and in order to give additional searchable information about them. Every build (app version) can have different tags.

#### How to add/edit tags

- Tags can be added programmatically when uploading the build via the [TestFairy Upload API](https://docs.testfairy.com/API/Upload_API.html) using the `tags` parameter.

- Once the build is loaded, Tags can be added, edited or deleted under [build settings](https://docs.testfairy.com/TestFairy_Dashboard/Builds.html) menu under __App Distribution__ --> __Tags__.

#### Displaying tags to admins

Tags appear in a project page:

In the dashboard, Tags are searchable in the `Search...` textbox available at the top right.

#### Displaying tags to testers

Testers can see Tags in their Testers Dahsboard available at [my.testfairy.com](my.testfairy.com):

Tags are also available at the top of every landing page, just below the main headline:
