## Tags

Tags are text labels that are attached to builds and used for identification and in order to give additional searchable information about them.

#### Ways to edit tags

- They are first added when uploading the build via the [upload API](https://docs.testfairy.com/API/Upload_API.html) using the `tags` parameter.

- Once the build is loaded they can be edited in the [build settings](https://docs.testfairy.com/TestFairy_Dashboard/Builds.html) menu under __App Distribution__ --> __Tags__.

#### Displaying tags

Once tags are added they appear in a the build details:

![](/img/dashboard/builds-table.png)  
  
`Tags` are searchable in the `Search...` field at the top of the table.

Tags also appear in the details of the build in the [my.testfairy.com](my.testfairy.com) (for the Tester view):

![](/img/app_distribution/builds-my-view.png)  

Tags are diplayed in the landing page under the main headline (when the build diplayed has tags):
