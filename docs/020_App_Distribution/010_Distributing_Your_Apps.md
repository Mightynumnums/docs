The distribution process starts with [loading your apps](https://docs.testfairy.com/Getting_Started/Upload_Apps.html) to Testfairy.
* If you have an Android app simply go to your dashboard and follow the instructions in the [Upload](https://docs.testfairy.com/Getting_Started/Upload.html) section.
* If you are distributing an iOS app with an [enterprise certificate](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/enterprise/) the process is identical to the android distribution. __Ad-hoc__ certificate iOS apps require some preparations described [here](https://docs.testfairy.com/iOS_SDK/Adding_UDIDs_to_iOS_development_profile.html).


After you have an app loaded you can start distributing it to your testers.

Distributing your app is a simple process:

- You will only need to decide if you want testers to login (verify) their account prior to download or just let anybody with the link download your app.


The distribution process described above can be done with a pre-registered list of testers or with invitations to testers that are sent for a specific build.


### Email invitations
Inviting your testers via email is done in two ways:
#### Pre invitation
Pre-inviting them by adding them to your testers list in the [TESTERS](https://app.testfairy.com/testers/) tab of the dashboard in advance, and then inviting them to the build in the invite testers menu of a specific build.

  The pre invitation is used when iOS apps are distributed to specific devices when you don't use an enterprise certificate.   It is also commonly used when you have an in house testing team.


#### Adding to a specific build
Adding their email to a specific build at the empty email box at the bottom of the testers list.

  ![add tester email](/img/getting-started/invite-testers-from-build-2.png).

This will send them an email with a download link and can be done with Android and iOS apps that are signed with an [enterprise certificate](https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/enterprise/). It is also commonly used when you have an in house testing team and want to add them to several builds and different apps.


### Landing pages

You can also build a community of testers or distribute you app by using our pre-designed [landing page](https://docs.testfairy.com/App_Distribution/Landing_Pages.html). The landing pages link can be sent to testers for downloading you apps. The download link in the landing page can also be secured by login (opt-in) requiring the testers to log in before downloading your app.


### Testers dashboard

The [tester dashboard](https://my.testfairy.com/) is the place where tester see all the apps they were invited to test.
This view is available to all testers in the system. Developer can switch from this view to the full dashboard view with the `view as developer` menu item.

### Permissions

Permissions (Group Permissions) are used in order to manage app distribution to groups of testers/users.

The permissions are defined for each app (and all its builds) so all testers that are part of the group can download all the apps builds.

The permissions are based on defining groups of testers as described in [Managing tester groups](https://docs.testfairy.com/Testers/Managing_Testers.html).

Once you have defined the groups of some or all of the testers the groups appear in the permissions screen.

  ![permissions](/img/app_distribution/permissions-screen-1.png)

Ticking the checkbox of a group makes the app (and all its builds) available for that group (and hence all its testers).
The app is then displayed in the [testers dashboard](https://docs.testfairy.com/TestFairy_Dashboard/Testers_Dashboard.html) and can be downloaded by the testers. Unchecking a group checkbox will remove the app from the testers dashboard that are part of that group.

### Production SDK

App distribution must not be used in production. [See here](https://docs.testfairy.com/Android/Production_SDK.html) to learn how to opt out.
