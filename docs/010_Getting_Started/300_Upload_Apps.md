We recommend using our <a href="https://docs.testfairy.com/API/Upload_API.html">Upload API</a> to enable our <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TestFairy+Plugin">Jenkins plugin</a>, <a href="#">Gradle plugin</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/testfairy/command-line-uploader" target="_blank">Command line uploader</a>. 

The code of our command line uploader, Jenkins and Gradle plugins is open source, so you can feel free to change and improve on it.

### Selecting Your Project Settings

You can define your build settings right in the upload process:

-- **In-app reporting** - Check this box to enable/disable the "shake to report" feature in your app. When enabled, users can simply shake their device to send out a feedback report, along with a video recording, screenshots, logs and metrics of their testing session.

-- **Auto-Update** - When auto update is enabled, users using previous versions of this app will get a notification about the new version next time they open up the app. The new version will be downloaded automatically, so the user doesn't have to actively download it. Please note that in this case no email notification will be sent to the testers.

-- **Custom Comments** - Use this section to add release notes, describe the updated/changes and write about anything else you would like your testers to be aware of.

Please note: these settings are relevant only if you added our SDK to your app.

### <a id="Uploading"></a> Updating an app

If you wish to update a build you already loaded, all you have to do is simply upload the same file again - the same build with the same version. 

The new build file will override the old build **without** creating a new app version.

### <a id="Uploading"></a> Uploading a new version

If you wish to upload a new build - which is a new version of the same app, all you have to do is upload the new version in the exact same way you've uploaded the old version. Our service will identify that both apps have the same package name (bundle identifier) and group them together in the same project (app).
