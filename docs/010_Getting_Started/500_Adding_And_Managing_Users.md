There are 3 types of users in the system:
1. **Account Manager** - an Admin account that in addition to Admin actions can add and delete other Admins. 
2. **Admin** - a user that can upload builds, delete builds and view and delete sessions. 
3. **Beta Tester** - a user that can only download apps. See [here](https://docs.testfairy.com/Getting_Started/How_To_Invite_Testers.html).
