### Instrumenting Device Farm Tests

### Android Instrumentation

With our open source Android Instrumentation runner, you can inspect individual test runs happening on AWS Device Farm through your TestFairy dashboard.

Install [these](https://blog.testfairy.com/device-farm-instrumentation-with-testfairy-android-sdk/) to initialize the SDK in your test suite.

Run your tests in Device Farm as **Instrumentation** to see it in action.

If you are new to AWS Device Farm, take a look at this introductory [blog post](https://github.com/testfairy-blog/TestFairyInstrumentationExamples) for a complete tutorial.
