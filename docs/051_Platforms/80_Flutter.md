### Adding TestFairy to your flutter project

If you are developing your app in flutter here are the instructions to add the TestFairy sdk.

#### Installing
Use this package as a library

### 1. Depend on it
Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

```
dependencies:
  testfairy: any
```

### 2. Install it
You can install packages from the command line:
with Flutter:
```
$ flutter packages get
```
Alternatively, your editor might support flutter packages get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

### 3. Import it
Now in your Dart code, you can use:
```
import 'package:testfairy/testfairy.dart';
```

### Quick Start
Include the library and run your main app like this. Make sure your project is [AndroidX](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/androidx-migration) compatible.

```dart
// inside your main.dart

import 'package:testfairy/testfairy.dart';

void main() {
    HttpOverrides.runWithHttpOverrides(
         () async {
           try {
             // Enables widget error logging
             FlutterError.onError =
                 (details) => TestFairy.logError(details.exception);
   
             // Initializes a session
             await TestFairy.begin(TOKEN);
   
             // Runs your app
             runApp(TestfairyExampleApp());
           } catch (error) {
   
             // Logs synchronous errors
             TestFairy.logError(error);
   
           }
         },
   
         // Logs network events
         TestFairy.httpOverrides(),
   
         // Logs asynchronous errors
         onError: TestFairy.logError,
   
         // Logs console messages
         zoneSpecification: new ZoneSpecification(
           print: (self, parent, zone, message) {
             TestFairy.log(message);
           },
         )
     );
}
```

### How to update native SDKs?
This is done automatically for Android. 

If you need to update the native iOS SDK used by your current integration, run `pod repo update; pod install` in your *ios* directory.

### Troubleshooting

* I see `Looks like TestFairy has an upgrade to do... 1.X.Y+hotfixZ is the latest stable branch` or errors related to Jetifier in the logs when I call an SDK method. --> Migrate your Android project to AndroidX by following [this](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/androidx-migration) guide.

* I see `Undefined symbols for architecture` error during compilation. --> You must use frameworks and specify a platform version of at least `9.0` in your generated iOS project's Podfile. Please make the following changes in *ios/Podfile* and rebuild:

  ```
  target 'Runner' do
   platform :ios, '9.0'   ####### <--- add this and specify at least 9.0

    use_frameworks!        ####### <--- add this, and try building if there is 
                           #######      no Swift code or plugin in the project.
                           #######      If there is Swift code, please also add 
                           #######      the marked line below
  
    ...
  end

  post_install do |installer|
   installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
      target.build_configurations.each do |config|
       config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'
        config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '3.2'  ### <--- add this, change the 
                                                        ### version to what's being
                                                        ### used in the project, 
                                                        ### remove if there is none
     end
    end
  end
  ```

* CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "TestFairy".

  This is an old bug in the plugin pubspec file. 
  
  - First, run `flutter clean` in your root directory. 

  - Please move *ios/Podfile.lock* into a temporary place before running `pod repo update; pod install` in your *ios* directory. 

  - If some of the libraries you use need to be at specific versions, copy the necessary lines from your backed up *Podfile.lock* into the newly created one. Please keep the lines related to TestFairy (note the title case in the name) untouched.

  - Finally, run `pod repo update; pod install` again to re-download libraries from the replaced lines.
   
   If everything went smoothly, this issue should never happen again.

* There are syntax errors in TestFairyFlutterPlugin.java or TestFairyFlutterPlugin.m file.

  In your project root, run `flutter clean; cd ios; pod repo update; pod install; cd ..` and test again.

* My widget's are not hidden in screenshots.

  This is currently not supported in iOS and will be fixed in the next release.
